Welcome to the 20-20-20 Rule Reminder!

## What is the 20-20-20 Principle?

The 20-20-20 rule is a simple guideline to help reduce eye strain and fatigue caused by prolonged screen time. It suggests that for every 20 minutes spent staring at a screen, you should take a 20-second break and look at something 20 feet away. This practice can help alleviate digital eye strain and maintain healthy vision.

## Why is it Significant?

In today's digital age, many of us spend long hours in front of screens, whether it's working on computers, browsing smartphones, or watching TV. This constant exposure to digital screens can lead to symptoms such as eye strain, dryness, blurred vision, headaches, and neck or shoulder pain. Adhering to the 20-20-20 rule can help reduce these symptoms and promote overall eye health.
